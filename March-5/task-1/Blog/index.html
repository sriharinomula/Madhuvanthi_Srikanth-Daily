    <h2>Prisoners of Uncertainity</h2>
   <p>Many a times we experience a personal sense of accomplishment , a "pat yourself on the back" feeling of the work we've done ,  8th March 2020 was one such day for me. Classes after the recess were suspended due to sports day and after promising my mollycoddling helicopter mom that I would be alert cum extra safe while walking and that I'd always hold somebody's hand while crossing the road  ,cute mommy had little choice but to agree .Never have I had the pleasure of travelling in a public transport with just one single coeval human accompaniment , till that day, as I came out of my college gate along with my friend. We took 3 share autos after which I had to walk all the way from anna arch to my house thanks to google maps and ofc my dearest chikni(my phone) . I came home with splitting headache and sharp agonizing twinge in my ankle after which I fell ill for the next few days. Least did I imagine it would be my last day at college ..... that’s when I realised change is definitely the only constant ...Today the pace of change is immensely faster, and it will only continue to accelerate ...The only way to make sense out of change is to plunge into it, move with it, and join the dance. Here I am today after a lonngggg year break ,back to my college with my mind running amok from thought to thought and memory to memory of all those lazy mornings,  virtual hangouts with cute backgrounds, occasional dance parties with my best chums  ..... though I might be excited about the fact of meeting my friends am not sure if I’m ready to subject myself to the tedium of everyday collegiate life and somewhere within me I know I still have slight trepidation of unprecedented risk that this pandemic could pose ....but yet again life is just a series of phases one after another after another ....We are all the prisoners of the uncertainty that life could throw upon us but we as evolved species with complete understanding of the empirical world need to perceive the greater reality irrespective of the curve balls thrown upon us
